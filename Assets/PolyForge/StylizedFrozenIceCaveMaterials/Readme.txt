Thank you for purchasing Stylized Frozen Ice Cave Materials.

Starting with Unity 2018.1, native support for Substance has been removed and 
now "Substance in Unity", avilable in the Asset Store is needed. However, native
Unity materials have been provided so that the pack can be used out of the box.

Due to size and memory considerations, height, metallic, smoothness and ambient occlusion 
are packed in a single texture. If you need the separate textures please contact us.

In order to access more complex features, such as randomizable textures, and 
customizable configurations please make sure to install "Substance in Unity".

For any questions, requests and/or bug reports please contact us at:
